# YOLO Preprocessing & Training & Testing
This repo is a collection of random sripts that I use for preprocessing data to create a dataset for YOLO (or other) models.

## utils-scripts
Contains a few scripts that create a clips of people from a video where there are people appearing in some random intervals. 
Clips can be made into a individual frames and then be randomly picked.

## training_scrips
A playground for scripts that run training from datasets

## inference_scripts
Another playground t test out the results of trained (or other) models
